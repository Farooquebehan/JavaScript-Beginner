JavaScript String Comparison
All the comparison operators above can also be used on strings:

Example
let text1 = "A";
let text2 = "B";
let result = text1 < text2;
//string addition
The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

Example
let text1 = "What a very ";
text1 += "nice day";
